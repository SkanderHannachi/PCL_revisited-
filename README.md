This is not a PCL Python wrapper (and has nothing to do with strawlab python-pcl binding). We needed a python script to compute PCL's filter CropBox and display data on Rviz so I made this. 
Will also work on other filters including : 
* cropHulls
* high/low pass filters
* clustering 
* etc.

So feel free to fork and join the project! 

tested on ROS jade, python 2.7 with Velodyne VLP16's Data and Microsoft's Kinect for Xbox 360.

have fun!
